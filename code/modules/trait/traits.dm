	description = "I remember my past. The training ground itself was a labyrinth of torment, with obstacles designed to break both body and spiritâ€”an obstacle course that promised pain with every misstep. The hum of energy weapons and the acrid smell of scorched flesh lingered as a haunting reminder of those who had faltered before. The relentless drills forged an iron discipline, but it was a discipline devoid of compassion. The recruits became masters of the art of war, but the cost was etched across their haunted expressions."
